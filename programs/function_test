.function addInts
    add r0, r1

.function subInts

.function doAddThenSub

# there is no functional difference between labels and functions
# both are actually interchangable
diffAddInts:
    add r0, r1
    mov r11, r0
    ret

# run should push the scratch registers [0 - 9]
# ret should then pop them back
# I like the .function over just labels for cleanliness
